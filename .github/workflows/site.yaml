### ### Drupal
###
### Checks that site can be installed and can be updated (from base branch on
### pull request).
###
### #### Assumptions
###
### 1. A docker compose service named `phpfpm` can be run and `composer` can be
###    run inside the `phpfpm` service.
### 2. The docker setup contains a database container and other the dependent
###    services and the default settings match connection credentials for these
###    services.
### 3. The Drupal site can be installed from existing config.
